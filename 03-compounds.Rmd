In climate research, a compound event refers to the combination of multiple extreme weather or climate events occurring simultaneously or successively, leading to significant impacts on the environment, society, or economy. These events can be related either through meteorological factors (e.g., heatwaves and drought occurring together due to a prolonged high-pressure system) or through their impacts (e.g., heavy rainfall and storm surge combining to cause more severe flooding). The complexity of compound events lies in their interconnectedness and the way they can exacerbate each other's effects, often in a nonlinear manner, making them more challenging to predict and manage than individual extreme events.

## Example: Hot and Dry Events

Consider a scenario where a region experiences both extreme heat and an extended period of low precipitation simultaneously. In this example, the compound nature of the hot and dry events creates a cascade of impacts that are more severe than what would be expected if these events occurred independently. The interplay between the heat and drought amplifies the consequences, underscoring the importance of understanding and managing compound events in the context of climate change and variability.
