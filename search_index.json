The quantification and definition of climate change, extreme events and its implications for life and health on our planet is one of the major concerns in climate science. This book explains current statistical methods in climate science and their application. The methods include compound events, low flow events and return periods, natural variability, teleconnections and causal discovery. All of those methods are used to quantify and anticipate the changing climate. This book is the outcome of the seminar “Climate and Statistics” which took place in summer 2024 at the Department of Statistics, LMU Munich.

"],["foreword.html", "Foreword Technical Setup", " Foreword Author: Christoph Molnar This book is the result of an experiment in university teaching. Each semester, students of the Statistics Master can choose from a selection of seminar topics. Usually, every student in the seminar chooses a scientific paper, gives a talk about the paper and summarizes it in the form of a seminar paper. The supervisors help the students, they listen to the talks, read the seminar papers, grade the work and then … hide the seminar papers away in (digital) drawers. This seemed wasteful to us, given the huge amount of effort the students usually invest in seminars. An idea was born: Why not create a book with a website as the outcome of the seminar? Something that will last at least a few years after the end of the semester. In the summer term 2019, some Statistics Master students signed up for our seminar entitled “Limitations of Interpretable Machine Learning”. When they came to the kick-off meeting, they had no idea that they would write a book by the end of the semester. We were bound by the examination rules for conducting the seminar, but otherwise we could deviate from the traditional format. We deviated in several ways: Each student project is part of a book, and not an isolated seminar paper. We gave challenges to the students, instead of papers. The challenge was to investigate a specific limitation of interpretable machine learning methods. We designed the work to live beyond the seminar. We emphasized collaboration. Students wrote some chapters in teams and reviewed each others texts. Technical Setup The book chapters are written in the Markdown language. The simulations, data examples and visualizations were created with R (R Core Team 2018). To combine R-code and Markdown, we used rmarkdown. The book was compiled with the bookdown package. We collaborated using git and github. For details, head over to the book’s repository. References R Core Team. 2018. R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing.

This variability can be due to a variety of factors, including atmospheric processes, ocean currents, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and other dynamic components of the Earth system. Natural variability occurs across all time scales, from short-term (daily, seasonal) to long-term (decadal, centennial) fluctuations. 2.1 Climate Model Ensemble Climate models are sophisticated tools that simulate the interactions within the Earth’s climate system. To understand and quantify natural variability, scientists use ensembles of climate model simulations. An ensemble consists of multiple runs of the same model, or different models, where each run has slightly different initial conditions or model parameters. This approach helps to capture the range of possible climate outcomes due to the inherent uncertainty and variability in the system. 2.2 Internal Variability Within the context of climate model ensembles, internal variability refers to the variations in climate that arise from the system’s internal processes, independent of external forcings. This variability is a fundamental part of the climate system’s dynamics and can lead to different outcomes even if the external conditions are the same. Deser et al.

It captures water deficits or surpluses on the land surface better than the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), which focuses solely on precipitation. The potential evaporation can be based on the so-called FAO grass evaporation, which takes into account radiation, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed over a standard grass area. The time series is broken down into 12 monthly frequency sums, to each of which a cumulative log-logistic distribution is fitted. This is transformed into a corresponding cumulative standard normal distribution, the abscissa value of which - referred to as SPEI - allows simple assignment to probability classes.

"],["ce.html", "Chapter 4 Compound events 4.1 Example: Hot and Dry Events", " Chapter 4 Compound events Authors: Author 1, Author 2 Supervisor: Henri Funk Suggested degree: Master In climate research, a compound event refers to the combination of multiple extreme weather or climate events occurring simultaneously or successively, leading to significant impacts on the environment, society, or economy. These events can be related either through meteorological factors (e.g., heatwaves and drought occurring together due to a prolonged high-pressure system) or through their impacts (e.g., heavy rainfall and storm surge combining to cause more severe flooding). The complexity of compound events lies in their interconnectedness and the way they can exacerbate each other’s effects, often in a nonlinear manner, making them more challenging to predict and manage than individual extreme events. 4.1 Example: Hot and Dry Events Consider a scenario where a region experiences both extreme heat and an extended period of low precipitation simultaneously. In this example, the compound nature of the hot and dry events creates a cascade of impacts that are more severe than what would be expected if these events occurred independently. The interplay between the heat and drought amplifies the consequences, underscoring the importance of understanding and managing compound events in the context of climate change and variability.

These relationships are critical for modeling the joint behavior of these variables, which can be essential for predicting weather events, designing structures, or managing natural resources. In the study of environmental and hydrological systems, recognizing and accurately modeling the asymmetry in bivariate relationships is crucial for making reliable predictions and informed decisions. Techniques such as copulas, are often used in this context to model and analyze these complex and dependencies effectively. To model the asymmetry in dependencies, Archimax could be used.

Teleconnections represent atmospheric interactions that link weather and climate conditions in one region of the globe with those in another, often through the movement and behavior of large-scale atmospheric wave patterns. These connections are crucial for understanding regional climate variations, predicting weather patterns, and assessing climate change impacts. 6.1 North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Its Implications The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a prime example of a teleconnection pattern, characterized by variations in the difference of atmospheric pressure at sea level between the Icelandic Low and the Azores High. The NAO influences weather and climate conditions across the North Atlantic region and beyond, affecting winter temperatures and storm tracks. 6.2 Implications for Our Climate Understanding the NAO and other teleconnection patterns is essential for accurate weather forecasting, climate prediction, and the development of strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate variability and change. Researchers use observations, climate models, and paleoclimate reconstructions to study these patterns, aiming to improve our ability to predict their future behavior under different climate change scenarios.

These events can result from prolonged periods of below-average precipitation, increased water usage, or changes in land use that affect the hydrological cycle. Low flow conditions can compromise water quality, reduce water availability for agricultural, industrial, and domestic uses, and disrupt aquatic ecosystems. 7.1 Concept of Extremeness by Return Periods The “extremeness” of hydrological events, including low flow conditions, is often characterized by return periods. A return period, also known as a recurrence interval, is a statistical measure used to estimate the frequency at which a certain intensity of an event (e.g., flow rate, rainfall amount) is likely to be equaled or exceeded. It is typically expressed in years. Definition: The return period is calculated based on historical data and is intended to provide an estimate of the likelihood of experiencing an event of a certain magnitude or greater within any given year. For example, a 100-year return period for a low flow event means that, on average, the flow rate is expected to fall to that level or lower once every 100 years. This does not imply the events will occur exactly 100 years apart but rather conveys a 1% chance of occurrence in any given year. Du et al.

These models help in water resource management, flood forecasting, environmental protection, and understanding the impact of climate change on water resources. There are mainly two types of hydrological models: physical and statistical. 8.1 Physical Hydrological Models Physical hydrological models are based on the physical processes that occur within the hydrological cycle. They use mathematical representations of these processes to simulate the behavior of water in the environment. Physical models consider processes such as precipitation, evaporation, infiltration, surface runoff, and groundwater flow. These models are often more complex and require detailed data about the terrain, soil properties, vegetation, and meteorological conditions. 8.2 Statistical Hydrological Models Statistical hydrological models use historical data to identify patterns and relationships between different hydrological variables. These models apply statistical methods to predict future water conditions based on past observations. They do not necessarily simulate the physical processes but rather rely on the statistical properties of the data, such as trends, cycles, and variability. Statistical models are often used when the physical processes are too complex to model directly or when there is insufficient data to build a detailed physical model. Sabzipour et al.
